# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Educational RPG Platform to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

#### JWT Token System
- **Access Tokens**: Short-lived (15 minutes in production)
- **Refresh Tokens**: Long-lived (30 days) with rotation
- **Token Storage**: HttpOnly cookies with Secure and SameSite flags
- **Blacklisting**: Revoked tokens stored in Redis

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```python
Roles:
- student: Basic user access
- parent: Can view child's progress
- teacher: Can manage classes and assignments
- admin: Full system access
```

#### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- TOTP-based authentication using Google Authenticator
- Backup codes for recovery
- QR code generation for easy setup

### 2. Data Encryption

#### Encryption at Rest
- **Database**: Encrypted using AWS RDS encryption
- **File Storage**: S3 server-side encryption with KMS
- **Sensitive Fields**: Field-level encryption using Fernet
- **PII Protection**: Automatic encryption of personal data

#### Encryption in Transit
- **TLS 1.2+**: All connections use modern TLS
- **Certificate Pinning**: Mobile apps use cert pinning
- **HSTS**: Strict Transport Security enabled

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization

#### Request Validation
- **Pydantic Models**: Type validation for all inputs
- **Size Limits**: Max request size of 10MB
- **Content Type**: Strict content-type checking

#### XSS Protection
- **Output Encoding**: All user content HTML-encoded
- **CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy enforced
- **React**: Automatic XSS protection in JSX

#### SQL Injection Prevention
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with parameterized queries
- **Input Scanning**: Pattern matching for SQL keywords
- **Prepared Statements**: No raw SQL execution

### 4. Security Middleware

#### Rate Limiting
```python
Limits:
- General API: 60 requests/minute
- Auth endpoints: 5 requests/minute
- Password reset: 3 requests/hour
```

#### Security Headers
```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000
Content-Security-Policy: [policy]
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
```

#### IP Whitelisting
- Admin endpoints restricted to whitelisted IPs
- Configurable per environment

### 5. Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

#### Attack Detection
- **Pattern Matching**: SQL injection, XSS, command injection
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Unusual request patterns
- **Geographic Anomalies**: Access from unexpected locations
- **Automated Blocking**: High-risk IPs auto-blocked

#### Monitoring & Alerts
- **Real-time Alerts**: Critical security events
- **Audit Logging**: All security events logged
- **Threat Intelligence**: Daily threat reports

### 6. Secure Development Practices

#### Code Security
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability checks
- **Static Analysis**: Bandit for Python security
- **Secret Detection**: Pre-commit hooks for secrets
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused PR reviews

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal IAM permissions
- **Network Isolation**: VPC with private subnets
- **Secrets Management**: AWS SSM Parameter Store
- **Backup Encryption**: All backups encrypted

### 7. Compliance & Privacy

#### Data Protection
- **GDPR Compliance**: Right to erasure, data portability
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary data
- **Consent Management**: Explicit user consent
- **Data Retention**: Automatic data purging

#### Security Auditing
- **Access Logs**: All data access logged
- **Change Tracking**: Audit trail for modifications
- **Compliance Reports**: Regular security reports

## Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Run security scan: `./scripts/security-scan.sh`
- [ ] Update all dependencies
- [ ] Rotate all secrets and keys
- [ ] Review security configurations
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Verify SSL/TLS setup
- [ ] Check CORS settings
- [ ] Enable all security headers

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor security alerts
- [ ] Review audit logs daily
- [ ] Check for new vulnerabilities
- [ ] Update WAF rules
- [ ] Test backup restoration
- [ ] Verify encryption working
- [ ] Check rate limit effectiveness

## Incident Response

### 1. Detection
